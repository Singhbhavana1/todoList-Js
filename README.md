# todoList-Js
This project is a simple To-Do List application built using vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to add, remove, and manage tasks directly in their browser. The tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that data persists even when the page is refreshed or the browser is closed and reopened.
